# Python Tutorial: Traffic Anonymization by leveraging TOR Network

I wrote a short article that outlines the process of using Python for communicating programmatically through TOR network nodes.

I demonstrate how to request multiple "what's my IP address" requests, each through a different TOR connection, and in a span of a minute get the Python script to use TOR nodes in France, USA, Russia, Moldova, but also in Netherlands, Austria and Germany (as they are randomly being presented by the TOR network).

The source code is attached here.
